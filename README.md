## Trivia Card (jQuery Project)

### Description

I decided to complete this Codecademy jQuery project in my code editor rather than the online portal to get a more holistic understanding of the file and DOM linkage. I used the supplied source code and completed the steps using Github version control to commit documentation. Here is the project description:

In this project, I will add jQuery Effects to a Trivia Card. I want the user to be able to read the clue, view an optional hint, and select their answer.

I will add a few different effects. A hint box will slide up and down. When you click an incorrect answer, it will fade away and a frowny face will appear. When you click the correct answer, the frowny face will disappear and a smiley face will take its place.

To complete this project, I must know how to target HTML elements in jQuery, how to create event handlers, and how to use several jQuery Effects methods.
